Debugging
=========

If you found any problem and need to do a Debug, then you should start Config Replicator in debugging mode, using the directive "-d":
::

    python main.py -d

This will cause a debug output to the terminal and to a file saved on the "debugs" folder with a format *Debug_OutputMMDDYYYHHMM.log*

This directive is not used by the gui version
