# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to "Config Replicator".

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing 
and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing 
your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

The Config Replicator tool is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! 
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, 
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the tool itself.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through the issues, if any or create one.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.


## Getting Started

1. Open a Pull Request to fix/implement an Issue, or you can also fork the project and then send a pull request
2. Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change proposed. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux, whenever's possible.
3. Ensure that no personal info, data or passwords were left on the 
3. Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently 
   and get community feedback.
4. Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
5. Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the Python Community Code of Conduct.
6. Update the README.md with details of the changes made, this includes but not limited to: new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
7. Update also the documentation in docs, we use Sphinx to generate the Docs
8. Increase the version numbers in any examples files, README.md and docs files to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent.
9. Wait for one of the developers to merge your code. Be Patient!

## How to file a bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Python are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead? 

## How to ask for a new feature

Open an issue, and the community will get to it as quick as possible, just understand that it may take some time, the developers are not 100% dedicated to this project.
